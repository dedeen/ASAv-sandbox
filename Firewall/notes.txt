Build the PA-VMs from the main .tf files after switching to AMI and instance type for Palo FW. 
After launch get the public IPs - 
  Samples:  10.100.0.10    54.190.115.247    <== this int is the mgmt int on PAVM
            10.100.1.10     - 
            10.100.2.10   52.12.216.139
            
ssh to public IP with keypair used for instance
ssh admin@54.190.115.247 -i terraform-key-pair.da11.pem

configure
set mgt-config users admin password 
commit
  (used std Ed..11)
Now you can use webui on the same external IP address.  

Admin pwd in the saved configs is Temp....!

I loaded the base config.xml from my ESXi system: 
  PANOS-running-config-1.xml
  On the PA-VN this is named PANOS-running-config-v1.xml. 
I added a lot of config from the PAN guide, not working yet. This is saved here as 
  running-config-inprogress-v2.xml
  
I continue to debug the environment. 

app1-az1 couldn't ping private PAVM-1 int (10.100.1.10) - adding 'devonly-allow-ping' fixed this issue.
