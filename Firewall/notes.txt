Build the PA-VMs from the main .tf files after switching to AMI and instance type for Palo FW. 
After launch get the public IPs - 
  Samples:  10.100.0.10    54.190.115.247    <== this int is the mgmt int on PAVM
            10.100.1.10     - 
            10.100.2.10   52.12.216.139
            
ssh to public IP with keypair used for instance
ssh admin@54.190.115.247 -i terraform-key-pair.da11.pem

configure
set mgt-config users admin password 
commit
  (used std Ed..11)
Now you can use webui on the same external IP address.  

Admin pwd in the saved configs is Temp....!

I loaded the base config.xml from my ESXi system: 
  PANOS-running-config-1.xml
  On the PA-VM this is named PANOS-running-config-v1.xml. 
I added a lot of config from the PAN guide, not working yet. This is saved here as 
  running-config-inprogress-v2.xml
  
I continue to debug the environment. 
works: app1-az1 ping private PAVM-1 int (10.100.1.10) - adding 'devonly-allow-ping' fixed this issue.
works: app1-az1 ping public PAVM-1 int (10.100.2.10) - adding 'devonly-allow-ping' fixed this issue.
works: dns resolves for app1-az1
works: PAVM-1 ping to app1-az1 
  >> routes between app1-az1 and awc-az1-int are good
  
Config notes: 
[Security Policies]
Health_Check_SecPol: (production)

DEVONLY_Allow_Ping_IMP = allow pings for debugging AWS internal configs 

[Route Tables]
VR_Inbound_Routes_PAVM1 
      (10.100.1.1 next hop). 
      Assign to eth1/1, eth1/1.1, eth1/2 
    For PAVM-2, need different RT, name it VR_Inbound_Routes_PAVM2
       Next hop 10.100.65.1 
 

[NAT


not work: ping outside addresses (dns does resolve)
